# A. Industry Background
##### [Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
## 1. Background on Industry
### 1.1 Background on Industry: Overview
Small and medium-sized accounting service firms are defined as all U.S. accounting firms
smaller than the “Big Four,” Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG.

**Firms:** approximately 93,000

**Primary Services:** bookkeeping, payroll, financial statement preparation, tax planning and compliance, and auditing

**Employment:** approximately 250,000 

**Revenue:** approximately $55 billion

### 1.2 Background on Industry: Importance of Information Technology
**Communications:** firm staff use information technology, especially e-mail, to timely communicate with clients, vendors, and other third-parties.

**Processing and storage:** firms process and store large volumes of data.

**Data Reception and Transmission:** firms receive and transmit data to and from clients and third parties using computer applications.

## 2. Threat Trends
**Phishing Schemes:**
Accounting service firms receive, process, store, and transmit sensitive personal and business information. In many circumstances, the receipt of or request for information from clients and third parties, such as regulatory agencies, might come through varied channels and be time sensitive.  This multiplicity of channels and sense of urgency increases the risk that employees will mistake phishing attempts for legitimate client or third-party information requests.

**Malware:**
Accounting service firm employees and systems often interact with many external systems and share many files through many different channels.  File sharing under these circumstances increases the risk of malware infection.  Additionally, the sensitive information held by these firms and the high business value of continuous data availability and operations make these firms particularly attractive ransomware targets.

**Data Breaches:**
The sensitive information that accounting service firms hold makes these firms targets of data breaches.  These firms are particularly susceptible to data breaches that arise from inappropriate access to the numerous employee, client, and vendor accounts that have access to this sensitive information.

# B. Threat Modelling
##### [Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
## 1. Critical Asset Identification
Nearly all firm employees use these critical assets as part of their daily activities.
The business models of these firms depends on the reliable integrity and availability of these critical assets.
The breach of sensitive personal and business data would subject these firms to breach reporting requirements and substantial regulatory, litigation, and reputational costs.

**Hardware:** the personal computers, phones, and servers used by the firm’s employees to receive, process, store, and transmit information

**Networks:** the software and hardware allowing communication and data transmission between firm employees, clients, and third-parties

**Software:** the standard enterprise applications and specialized accounting-related software used by the firm’s employees

**Shared Resources:** the applications and interfaces connecting the firm systems with those of clients and third-parties

**Data:** sensitive personal and business information, such as SSNs, PPI, PHI, tax identifiers, and trade secrets

## 3. Intelligence Buy-In
### 3.1 Intelligence Buy-In: Risk and Value of Enhanced Security
Accounting service firms hold sensitive personal and business information that is an attractive target of data breaches.

The high business value of continuous data availability and operations make these firms particularly attractive targets of ransomware.

Data breaches and disruptions to data availability and operations have significant regulatory, litigation, and reputational costs for these firms.

Because of the above, enhanced security has high value for these firms.

### 3.2 Intelligence Buy-In: AI Capabilities and Value
Small and medium-sized accounting service firms often have high demand for limited cybersecurity resources and personnel.

The implementation of AI automation for cybersecurity tasks will help to free cybersecurity resources and personnel for higher priority tasks.

The large number of client, vendor, and other third-party accounts, communication channels, and system connections limits the ability of cybersecurity personnel to detect     anomalous patterns in related activity data.

The implementation of AI pattern recognition can help cybersecurity personnel to find actionable patterns in this voluminous activity data.

# D. Data Collection Strategies and Summary
##### [Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
## 1. Collection Strategies
Applicable data sets were collected through Mendeley Data’s search function using cybersecurity related search terms, including the specific threats and vulnerabilities most applicable to small and medium-sized accounting service firms.
Data sets were downloaded and stored as .csv files.
This approach is especially accessible and flexible.
Thousands of academicians, researchers, and practitioners have viewed and downloaded applicable cybersecurity-related data sets from this source to train, test, and calibrate their cybersecurity models and applications.

## 2. Summary of Data: Phishing Dataset Example
Tan 2018 Dataset:
5000 phishing webpages and 5000 legitimate webpages are provided.
The phishing webpages were downloaded from Phishtank and OpenPhish from January to May of 2015 and from May to June of 2017.
The legitimate webpages were determined using Alexa and Common Crawl.
48 features are provided for each webpage.
Features relate to the URL name, content of the webpage, and external services.
