Phishing Schemes:
Accounting service firms receive, process, store, and transmit sensitive personal and business information. In many circumstances, the receipt of or request for information from clients and third parties, such as regulatory agencies, might come through varied channels and be time sensitive.  This multiplicity of channels and sense of urgency increases the risk that employees will mistake phishing attempts for legitimate client or third-party information requests.

Malware:
Accounting service firm employees and systems often interact with many external systems and share many files through many different channels.  File sharing under these circumstances increases the risk of malware infection.  Additionally, the sensitive information held by these firms and the high business value of continuous data availability and operations make these firms particularly attractive ransomware targets.

Data Breaches:
The sensitive information that accounting service firms hold makes these firms targets of data breaches.  These firms are particularly susceptible to data breaches that arise from inappropriate access to the numerous employee, client, and vendor accounts that have access to this sensitive information.
